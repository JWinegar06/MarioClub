            <h2>The World of Dragon Age</h2>
            <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/66db51bcf8754695640b4b293ccdf0d4/tumblr_inline_oa14ckn67R1tapoxn_1280.jpg" class="profile-pic"alt="Thedas Map">
            <p>Set in the world of Thedas (an acronym for The Dragon Age Setting), with events from the main series games taking place primarily in its southern regions. 
               Thedas is the only continent of the known world and consists of various clans, nations and states inhabited by multiple humanoid peoples. 
               Several kingdoms and countries have emerged over nine centuries of a calendar era based on the traditionally reckoned year of the founding of The Chantry, 
               the dominant religious organization in the Dragon Age series, and each century is referred to as a separate "Age". Three out of several human nations play a 
               prominent role in the series: the kingdom of Ferelden to the southeast of Thedas, which is politically organized in a similar manner to the English peerage system; 
               the Orlesian Empire to the west of Ferelden, where its nobility is notorious for undermining each other with intrigue and subterfuge in their jostling for favor 
               and patronage with its absolutist ruler; and the Tevinter Imperium in the northern region of Thedas, which once subjugated southern Thedas during ancient times, 
               and is governed by a powerful magocracy of magic-wielding magisters led by an Imperial Archon. Other noteworthy civilizations explored in the main series games 
               include the Free Marches, a human-dominated confederation of politically independent territorial entities to the north of Ferelden, and the Kingdom of Orzammar, 
               one of the few remaining dwarven city states scattered throughout the Deep Roads, an underground highway system beneath the surface of Thedas created by the dwarves millennia ago.</p>

                    <h4>The Warden</h4>
                    <p>Recruited by Duncan, the current Warden-Commander of Ferelden's, to aid King Cailan Theirin 
                       and his troops against an incoming army of darkspawn at Ostagar. The Warden's primary mission is to 
                       gather an army and defeat the Fifth Blight; however, political tensions, disruptions and 
                       numerous other distractions (and inspirations) are bound to cross this hero's path.

                    <h4>The Champion</h4>
                    <p> Hawke is the eldest child of the human Hawke family and hails from the nation of Ferelden.
                      Hawke's family flee northwards to the Free Marches region as refugees from the invading Darkspawn hordes. Settling down 
                      in the city-state of Kirkwall soon after arrival, Hawke emerges as a prominent figure within the span of a decade, 
                      rising in power and influence to become the "Champion of Kirkwall". Hawke is a pivotal figure behind the origins of the
                      worldwide conflict between the Mages and their custodians, the Templar Order.

                    <h4>The Inquisitor</h4>
                    <p>The Circle of Magi have rebelled against the oppressive templars in a bid for independence, leading to all-out war. In a last ditch effort for peace, 
                       Divine Justinia V has orchestrated a peace summit between the ambassadors of the templars and the mages for the purpose of 
                       negotiating a peaceful compromise. A massive explosion kills the attendees of the Conclave and creates a massive tear in the Veil called the Breach,
                       allowing Demons to invade Thedas unchecked. As the sole survivor of the explosion and wielder of the "Anchor", a magical mark that bestows control over
                       the Breach and Fade rifts, the miraculous accolades and ability to seal the Fade rifts leaves many to believe they are the Herald of Andraste.
                       Inducted into the reborn Inquisition, an independent organization sanctioned by the late Divine Justinia to restore order should Thedas erupt
                       into chaos, and eventually becomes the Inquisitor.
