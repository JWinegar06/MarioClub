                    <h4>Anderfels</h4>
                    <p>The Anderfels is a kingdom in northwestern Thedas. It is the poorest and most desolate nation in Thedas, as several Blights have ravaged the country, 
                        leaving great expenses of its territory so devoid of life that corpses can't even decay. It is best known for being the birthplace of the Grey Wardens 
                        and the site of their headquarters, Weisshaupt Fortress. As the darkspawn remain a constant threat to the Anders, even in the absence of a Blight, 
                        the Grey Wardens wield great influence in the country. While the monarchy resides in relative comfort in the capital of Hossberg, most of the population 
                        outside of the city needs to fend for themselves in small, self-sufficient villages and relies on the Wardens for security. These harsh conditions have 
                        led the Anders to become the most devout Andrastians and the deadliest soldiers.

                    <h4>Antiva</h4>
                    <p> The Principality of Antiva, or simply Antiva, is a plutocratic nation in northeastern Thedas known for its wine, sailing and merchants. Although it possesses 
                        few resources of its own, Antiva's location makes it a center for trade in the north. Antiva's wine trade, buoyed by its fruitful vineyards and an aggressive 
                        approach to trading practices with other nations, is one of the country's main resources, allowing for a relatively prosperous life for its citizens. Its capital, 
                        Antiva City, is one of the wealthiest in Thedas for that reason.[1] Antiva generally takes a neutral and passive approach to cross-border conflicts. While it has 
                        no standing army of its own, the reputation of the Antivan Crows, the deadliest guild of assassins in Thedas, is generally enough to deter other nations from open 
                        conflict.

                    <h4>Fereleden</h4>
                    <p>Ferelden is a kingdom located in southeastern Thedas. It borders Orlais along the Frostback Mountains to the west, the Amaranthine Ocean to the east, 
                        the Waking Sea to the north and the Korcari Wilds to the south. Most of the nation is dominated by a vast plain known as the Bannorn. The eastern third 
                        of the nation is dominated by the Brecilian Forest, whilst the west of the nation comprises Lake Calenhad. The nation is a feudal elective monarchy. 
                        It is ruled by a king or queen who is elected by the Landsmeet. Its capital is Denerim.

                    <h4>Free Marches"</h4>
                    <p> The Free Marches encompass a group of wealthy city-states across central and eastern Thedas. The area now corresponding to the Free Marches was originally 
                        settled by various barbarian tribes before becoming part of the Tevinter Imperium. After Andraste and Maferath liberated southern Thedas from Tevinter, the area 
                        was given to their son Evrion to rule. When Maferath's betrayal was revealed, Evrion dispersed his holdings among his people. As a result, the Free Marches never 
                        fully coalesced into a single nation. Their cities only form a loose confederation that rarely unites on any matter. Each city-state has its own form of government 
                        and its own culture. Outside aggression and the Grand Tourney are the only things that reliably unite the Marchers. In the event of attack from larger neighbors, 
                        the Marchers can assemble a joint military front that even the greatest powers cannot dismiss.[1] The three city-states with any real power in the Marches are Kirkwall, 
                        Starkhaven and Tantervale, each led by a titled official with the privilege of naming their city's Champion. Nevarra City, once a powerful Marcher city-state, broke off
                        in the Exalted Age to form its own nation.

                    <h4>Nevarra</h4>
                    <p> Nevarra is a kingdom located in central Thedas. The area now corresponding to Nevarra was first settled by the Planasene tribe. It was originally part of the
                     Tevinter Imperium, then claimed its independence to become one of the larger Marcher city-states. From its now-capital of Nevarra City, Nevarra rapidly expanded to 
                     become a nation proper in the Exalted Age.[1] Thanks to enormous wealth and a strategic central location in Thedas, some claim Nevarra's power now rivals that of the 
                     Orlesian Empire.

                    <h4>Orlais</h4>
                    <p> The Orlesian Empire, or simply Orlais, is one of the largest and most powerful human nation in Thedas due to its religious influence and military strength. As the 
                        historic home of the Orlesian Chantry and Divine, the Empire has maintained its privileged relationship with the religious institution since its establishment 
                        in -3 Ancient. The Orlesian Empire is known throughout Thedas for its extravagant culture and intricate politics, embodied by the Grand Game. The Empire is a
                        monarchy ruled by an Emperor or Empress. The capital is Val Royeaux, which is also the seat of the Orlesian Chantry.

                    <h4>Rivain</h4>
                    <p> Rivain is a kingdom in northeastern Thedas. Located on a peninsula, it is almost wholly surrounded by water, only connected to neighboring Antiva by a land bridge. 
                        Its geographical isolation has made it a human nation unlike any other. Traditionally, Rivain is a matriarchal society, and though it is officially ruled by a monarch,
                         most communities look to their eldest women for guidance. The most senior of these are called seers and freely practice magic. The Rivaini's unwillingness to part with
                          their mages has made it hard for Andrastianism to fully take hold. Many Rivaini stick to their traditional pantheistic beliefs that their god and the universe are 
                          the same. In addition, many Rivaini converted to the Qun following the Qunari invasion in the Steel Age.

                    <h4>Tevinter Imperium</h4>
                    <p> The Tevinter Imperium, or simply Tevinter, is the oldest extant human nation and the only magocracy in Thedas. In ancient times, in the wake of their destruction of 
                        the elven empire, the Imperium held uncontested dominion over the entire continent for almost a millennium. Several Blights, Exalted Marches and a protracted war with 
                        the Qunari have led to Tevinterâ€™s decline. Despite having lost much of its power, the Imperium remains a very powerful nation. Its culture is distinguished by the
                        importance of mages, the Imperial Chantry as well as the open practice of slavery. For these reasons, as well as its history as a conqueror and the role its magisters 
                        played in starting the Blights, Tevinter is the most hated nation in Thedas.
