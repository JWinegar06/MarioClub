                    <h4>Dwarves</h4>
                    <p>The dwarves, or dwarva, as they refer to themselves, are one of the major humanoid races of the Dragon Age setting. Strong, stocky, and shorter than any other 
                        humanoid race, the dwarves are skilled builders and boast a long tradition of courage and martial skill that has served them well in their millennia-long battle 
                        against the darkspawn.
<br>
                        They once developed a vast underground empire of twelve great thaigs that spanned the breadth of Thedas with its population outnumbering both the humans and the elves.
                        However their world was all but destroyed during the First Blight, and they are now a race in decline.
<br>
                        The single-mindedness of the dwarves is credited for the race's survival. Their ability to dedicate their efforts to a cause helped them survive in 
                        conditions that no other race would have long been able to and gave rise to a level of technology that far surpasses anything else in Thedas.

                    <h4>Elves</h4>
                    <p> A humanoid race, elves have a slender, lithe build, large eyes, and pointed ears. Long ago, the elves were the dominant race on Thedas, and their advanced 
                        civilization was based on nature, the Fade and magic. After the fall of their great city of Arlathan and the empire of Elvhenan, plunder by the Tevinter Imperium 
                        and the subsequent generations of slavery, the elves lost most of their cultural heritage and identity. They attempted to rebuild their society in the Dales, but 
                        after three centuries the Dales fell to one of the Chantry's Exalted Marches.
<br>
                        Since then, the elves have separated into two distinct groups: the Dalish, who choose to lead nomadic lives and strive to keep elven culture alive rather than 
                        submit, and the city elves, who live alongside humans, usually as impoverished outcasts, and have adopted many human customs. Many elves are still held as slaves
                        within Tevinter, and many others have joined the Qunari in hopes for better lives. Overall, the elves are now a people associated with poverty, crime and barbarism,
                        and are often used as scapegoats for humanity's difficulties. In Ancient Tevinter elves were called "rattus". Modern humans use the racial slurs "bat face," 
                        "knife ears", "slant-eared" or, less cruelly, "rabbit". Though most of the elven language has been lost, they once referred to themselves as "elvhen", which 
                        means "the People".

                    <h4>Humans</h4>
                    <p>Humans are the most numerous, yet also the most contentious of all the races of Thedas. Only four times have they ever united beneath a single banner, the last being 
                       centuries ago. The monotheistic faith of the Chant of Light plays a major role in human society. The majority of humanity in Thedas descended from numerous human tribes.

                    <h4>Qunari</h4>
                    <p> The Qunari (literally, "People of the Qun") is the umbrella term most commonly used to describe the metallic-skinned, usually horned race of large humanoids and their 
                        society that governs the islands of Par Vollen and Seheron, as well as the settlement of Kont-aar in northern Rivain, and Qundalon in the Anderfels.
<br>
                        Members of any race who adhere to the teachings of the Qun can become "Qunari", but those other than the original giant race, that is humans, elves, and dwarves, 
                        are called Viddathari within the Qun.[3] Humans of Rivain and elven slaves of Tevinter are especially susceptible to conversion, although it is not unknown for 
                        members of other groups to embrace the Qun.
